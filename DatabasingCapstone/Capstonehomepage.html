<h3>About Me</h3>
</div>

<div>
<p> I am a 17-year-old Punjabi Sikh student that is on a journey to become a software engineer. 
    Sikhi is a huge part of who I am because many of my core beliefs come from Sikhism. 
    My parents instilled many of its practices in me which overall made me a better human being. 
    Sikhs are known to be the most respectful, courageous, and selfless people so I try my best to live up to their name. 
    My parents immigrated here with a farming background to give me and my brother a better life. 
    They didn't want us to completely stray away from our farming roots because working on our orchard taught us many life lessons, they wanted us to strive for something more which for me is becoming a software engineer. 
    I always knew that I wanted to go into engineering or science since math and science were more my strong suite and I've always had a slight interest in computers. 
    This interest only grew the more I coded, eventually it became the perfect match. </p>

<h3>Project Backstory</h3>
</div>

<div style="display: inline-block; max-width: 69%;">
<p style="font-size: 150%;">My journey first started off when I helped my brother build his first computer, it was such a new realm to me I was purely amazed. 
    The school had started to teach us pseudocode which taught me the basics of coding languages which got me more invested.
    One of the major programs I enrolled myself in was a dual credit program called Gateway 2 Tech which is held at Okanagan College.
    This is where my coding knowledge started to blast off as before this, the only experience I had with coding previously was python and pseudocode.
    We learned about HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and SQL which are all major languages with web design and databasing. </p>

<h3>Mentor</h3>
</div>

<div style="display: inline-block;max-width: 69%;">
<p style="font-size: 150%;">Throughout the creation of our Capstone projects, we were given guidance by a mentor of our choosing. 
    They should be someone who has experience in the field so for my mentor I chose Sebi Unipan. 
    I met him through my brother as they were both in graduating class of 2023 and became friends while in university. 
    My mentor contributed a great deal of time to this project through his guidence on the learning aspect, creation aspect, and design/creativity aspect. 
    Thoughout University, he opted into the co-op program which led to job experience and gaining connections in the field. 
    He is currently employed as a lead Web Developer at Rental Hunt which helps people with their renting needs.

<h3>Future Aspirations</h3>
</div>


<p>I have a path in mind already for my journey to become a software engineer. 
    My plan is for me to get enrolled into U.B.C. Okanagan to work towards a Bachelor of Science degree where I will major in Computer Science. 
    I will enroll myself in the Co-op program to gain more job experience, build up my resume, and to gain connections to potential employers. 
    This project helps me gain a footing in the industry as it gives me exposure as an up-and-coming programmer. 
    I am also able to get a glimpse into what a day as a software engineer could look like. </p>
