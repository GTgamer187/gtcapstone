<h2>Basics of Coding</h2>
</div>

<p>
    <b>Syntax:</b> Each programming language has its own set of rules and conventions (syntax) that must be followed for the computer to understand the instructions.
</p><p>
    <b>Variables:</b> They are used to store data, kind of like a container. The value of the variable can change throughout the execution of a program
</p><p>
    <b>Data Types:</b> Different types of data, such as integers, floats, strings, and booleans, are used to represent various kinds of information  
</p><p>
    <b>Conditionals:</b> A conditional statement takes inserted data and returns a result depending on the data. The most widely known is an if statement.
</p><p>
    <b>Loops:</b> Loops continually executes a  block of code depending on if a certain condition is being met. They help with the organization and functionality of the code.
</p><p>
    <b>Functions:</b> A function is a collection statements which are grouped together to perform a certain operation. They also help keep the code organized and easier to manipulate.
</p><p>
    <b>Algorithms:</b> An algorithm is a step by step, presice, and systematic method for solving a problem and producing a result.
</p><p>
    <b>Input:</b> A program can receive data from the user like a key press or mouse click but they can also recieve data from the programmer that could be essential like a file or image.
</p><p>
    <b>Output:</b> Output can shown on the users display but also can be the result of conditional statement, loop, function, or algorithm.
</p><p>
    <b>Debugging:</b> Debugging involves finding and correcting errors in the code to ensure it runs smoothly. This involves rigorous testing which helps verify that the code performs as expected under various conditions.
</p><p>
    <b>Indentation and spacing:</b> Depending on the language indentation might be included in the syntax when using a conditional, loop, or function. However, it is still generally good practice to indent and space out peices of code to keep it organized and easy to understand.
</p><p>
    <b>Comments:</b> Adding comments within the code explains its functionality, making it easier to understand.

<h3>My experience:</h3>
</div>

<p>I had much of the basics set from the programming course I took in grade 11 as that was my first time properly coding. 
    We mostly only used python which in our case is quite similar to JavaScript. 
    However, G2T was able to strengthen the foundation that the grade 11 course had laid since G2T was able to expand on aspects that apply not only to python but also to other languages. 
    The more a person codes and the more languages a person codes in, the more grounded and expanded their foundation will be which is mainly how G2T thrived over the other course.</p>

<h2>Community Support</h2>
</div>

<p>Throughout the creation of this project, my mentor was not the only person to give guidance and assistance. 
    The coding community was very helpful and supportive with some of the issues I faced. 
    When you face an error while coding, there is always a very likely chance that someone else has faced the same issues as you. 
    There are many online forums for people to go to where other experienced programmers are able to help find a solution and they explain step by step what is going wrong with the code and how their solution will fix it. 
    These forums are what connect programmers into such a tight knit community as they are always collaborating together to help each other out.</p>
